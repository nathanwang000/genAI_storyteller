* genAI_storyteller

This is a project with Hao and Jeeheh.

Our goal is to create storybooks generated using generative AI models
- LLMs for story text generation
- Stable Diffusion for illustrations (either picture or video)
- (Optional) Text to speech narration of the story

Currently we have a utility to create animation video from a driving video

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python video2video.py
python create_video_from_images.py
#+END_SRC

The source video is [[./example.mp4][example.mp4]]
With the prompt of "tiger" and negative prompt of "worst-quality",
the output is [[./example_output.mp4][example_output.mp4]]
